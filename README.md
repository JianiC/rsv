# RSV

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a single strand 15kb -RNA virus.

This repository contains [nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org) builds which are available through the [nextstrain community functionality](https://nextstrain.org/docs/contributing/community-builds) via the following URLs:

#### Methods

RSV Whole-genome sequences as well as different single-genome sequences (G gene, F gene) were retrieved from Genbank.

Different searching terms have been used to get RSV sequences.
Search method 1: 
```
("Human Respiratory syncytial virus"[Organism] OR Respiratory syncytial virus[All Fields]) AND "Human orthopneumovirus"[porgn] AND *GeneName*)
```
Search method 2:
```
("Human Respiratory syncytial virus X "[Organism] OR Respiratory syncytial virus[All Fields]) AND "Human orthopneumovirus"[porgn] AND *GeneName*)
```
where `X = A` or `X = B `
