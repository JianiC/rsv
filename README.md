# rsv
This is the nextstrain build for Human Respiratory syncytial virus.

## Aim
Previous RSV sequencing studies have largely focused on partial sequencing of the G gene (200-300 nucleotides) for genotype characterization or diagnostics. Here, we build phylogeny of rsv using G gene, F gene and whole genmome sequences. Here, we examine whether current genotype assignment could recapitulate the phylogenetic signal of other genes with the genotype information extracted from genbank. We aim to examine the genetic diversity and phylogenetic signature of RSV and review the evolutionary systematics of RSV on a global scale.

## Data
RSV Whole-genome sequences as well as different single-genome sequences (G gene, F gene) were retrieved from Genbank.

Metadata including (genotype,isolated country and date) were extracted using a little C program gbmunge https://github.com/sdwfrost/gbmunge. Isolated countries information were further coded into 6 WHO region for the analysis purpose.
